architecture behaviour of selectAndEncodeLogic is

component decoder16bits is

decoderInput <= IRin(26 downto 23) when (Gra = '1' and Grb = '0' and Grc = '0')
			  else IRin(22 downto 19) when (Gra = '0' and Grb = '1' and Grc = '0')
			  else IRin(18 downto 15) when (Gra = '0' and Grb = '0' and Grc = '1');
